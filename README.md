This Discord Bot doesn't do a lot. 

How To Use Bot:
---------------
- Clone or download the python file onto your computer, (make sure to unzip the file).
- Download the required files on https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py and follow instructions.
- Go on https://discord.com/developers/applications, create a new application, name it whatever you like, open the side bar, press 'Bot' and press 'Add Bot'. Copy the token from the page and paste it in the python file in line 26.
- Add a role called 'Pit Of Shame', and change the settings so that the user with that role cannot message on any of the channels.
- Run the file.

Joining & Leaving A Server:
----------------------------
- When you join a server it'll send you a message saying 'Welcome exampleUser#0000 to the fish cult!'
- When you leave a server it'll send you a message saying 'You have been kicked from the fish cult for you have displeased the fish lord.'

Helo Fish Greeting:
-------------------
- Everytime you type 'helo' in a message on a channel, the bot will send a helo fish meme with 'exampleUser#0000 has summoned the fish lord.'

No more UwU:
------------
- Everytime someone types 'Uwu' into a channel the bot will mute the user for a minute and reply with the message 'exampleUser#0000 has uttered the forbidden words.'

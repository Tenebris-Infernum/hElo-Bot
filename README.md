# hElo-Bot
This Discord Bot doesn't do a lot. 

Joining & Leaving A Server:
----------------------------
- When you join a server it'll send you a message saying 'Welcome exampleUser#0000 to the fish cult!'
- When you leave a server it'll send you a message saying 'You have been kicked from the fish cult for you have displeased the fish lord.'

Helo Fish Greeting:
-------------------
- Everytime you type 'helo' in a message on a channel, the bot will send a helo fish meme with 'exampleUser#0000 has summoned the fish lord.'

No more UwU:
------------
- Everytime someone types 'Uwu' into a channel the bot will mute the user for a minute and reply with the message 'exampleUser#0000 has uttered the forbidden words.'
